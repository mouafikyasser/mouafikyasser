### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm Yasser Mouafik, a 14-year-old student from Morocco who is currently in middle school. I have a passion for programming and have been learning Python, C, and HTML/CSS. As a beginner programmer, I am always seeking opportunities to improve my skills and become a good programmer. I am excited to share my projects on GitHub and hope to learn from others in the community. Thank you for visiting my page!
